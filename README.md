# NLSE-Numerical-Solver
Numerical analysis of Bright Envelope Solitons and Modulational Instability (MI) in dispersive media. Demonstrates Multiple Scale Perturbation Theory applications in nonlinear plasma dynamics.
This repository contains a Python-based numerical framework for solving and visualizing the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE) in the context of complex plasma systems. It is specifically designed to model the formation and propagation of Bright Envelope Solitons.
Physical Context: The code simulates nonlinear periodic waves where the balance between dispersion (represented by the coefficient P) and nonlinearity (represented by the coefficient Q) allows for stable, localized energy packets.
Key Research Focus:
Modulational Instability (MI): Analyzes the conditions under which a continuous wave train breaks into localized pulses.
Plasma Parameters: Tailored for studies involving superthermal ($\kappa$-distributed) plasmas, quantum dusty plasmas, and the effects of polarization and self-gravity forces.
Jeans Instability: Investigates the role of gravitational collapse in dusty plasma environments.
FeaturesStatic Profile Generation: Visualizes the sech-type envelope and the underlying carrier wave.
Temporal Evolution: Includes a FuncAnimation suite to demonstrate the stability of solitons during propagation through the medium.
Multiple Scale Perturbation Theory: The underlying logic follows the perturbative approach used to derive the NLSE from fluid equations.
